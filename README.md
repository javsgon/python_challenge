# Python Challenge

## Background
In this assignment, we are using the concepts we've learned to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. 
Both tasks present a real-world situation where your newly developed Python scripting skills come in handy.

## Before You Begin
Before starting the assignment, be sure to complete the following steps:

Create a new repository for this project called python-challenge. Do not add this homework assignment to an existing repository.

Clone the new repository to your computer.

Inside your local Git repository, create a folder for each Python assignment and name them PyBank and PyPoll.

In each folder that you just created, add the following content:

1-A new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.

2-A Resources folder that contains the CSV files you used. Make sure that your script has the correct path to the CSV file.

3-An analysis folder that contains your text file that has the results from your analysis.

Push these changes to GitHub.

## Files
Download the Module 3 Challenge files to help you get started: budget_data.csv and election_data.csv

## PyBank Instructions
In this Challenge, we are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. We are given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

- The total number of months included in the dataset

- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Your analysis should align with the following results:

In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## PyPoll Instructions
In this Challenge, we are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

We are given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

- The total number of votes cast

- A complete list of candidates who received votes

- The percentage of votes each candidate won

- The total number of votes each candidate won

- The winner of the election based on popular vote

Your analysis should align with the following results:

In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
